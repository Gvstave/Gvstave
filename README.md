# Hey there! :wave:, I'm Gustave.

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I am an aspiring software engineer with a keen interest in full-stack web development and a deep passion for operating system (OS) research, design, and development. Throughout my academic journey, I have worked closely with colleagues on various projects, which has honed my experience in various fields of computer science.
 I am constantly learning new technologies and eager to work with a larger team to learn new things and share my knowledge with others. Besides programming, I enjoy programming.
